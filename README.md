voice to the silent💥🔥💯
Dec 2020

Project description for the event “Hackathon” organized by <Academia de código_>🔥🔥🔥

//The Idea💡💡💡---->
The main concept of our web app was to be the bridge between the institutions (representing the people in need), and whoever wants to help: making someone happy, donating goods, spending their time teaching, giving money, etc. “Voice to the Silent” is a platform that wants to give visibility to the ones that can’t achieve it otherwise, the main goal is to unite in one place several institutions and persons in need, in order to create a good and trustworthy place where the ones that want to help someone can do it easily (friendly-user platform).

//The Development💻💻💻---->
The group had 24 hours to brainstorm the idea, structure, build and present the project to the judges.
We started the day by brainstorming several ideas until we came up with the concept and planned project. Then, we designated tasks according to the group members capabilities (strengths and weaknesses) and divided the group members in front-end and back-end teams. We developed our web app using Java 10 for the back-end and we used Bootstrap, CSS and HTML5 for the front-end.

//My Role🖖🖖🖖---->
I was part of the the back-end team, responsible for the Spring and Thymeleaf implementation, Tomcat management and for the connection between back-end and front-end. In the back-end i have created the model classes and bootstrap classes to populate containers with the models. i have also implemented some buttons on the front-end.

//Tech && Methodologies⚙️⚙️⚙️---->
Java, IntelliJ, Git, OSX, Networking, Maven, Spring, Tomcat, Thymeleaf, Spring, Spring MVC, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap.
